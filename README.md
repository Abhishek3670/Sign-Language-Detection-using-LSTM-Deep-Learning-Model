# Sign Language Detection using LSTM Deep Learning Model

## Overview

This project implements a **sign language detection** system utilizing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model. The aim is to accurately recognize and classify sign language gestures from video input, helping bridge the communication gap for hearing-impaired individuals.

## Features

- **Real-time Gesture Recognition** through webcam or video input
- Robust **keypoint detection** using computer vision techniques
- **Sequence modeling** with LSTM networks for sequential gesture analysis
- Conversion of predicted gestures into **text or speech output**

## Architecture

| Step                | Description                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Video Capture       | Captures real-time video of hand/body movements  |
| Keypoint Detection  | Extracts landmarks using OpenCV/MediaPipe        |
| Sequence Formation  | Organizes keypoints into gesture sequences       |
| LSTM Inference      | Classifies gestures based on sequential data     |
| Output              | Converts recognized gesture to text or speech    |

**Model:**
- Sequential LSTM layers for time-series input
- Dense layers for classification
- Dropout layers for regularization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek3670/Sign-Language-Detection-using-LSTM-Deep-Learning-Model.git
cd Sign-Language-Detection-using-LSTM-Deep-Learning-Model


2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**
- Download and organize your sign language gesture videos or images as described in [Dataset](#dataset).

2. **Train the Model**
python train.py

3. **Run Real-Time Detection**
python detect.py
## Dataset

- Collect or download gesture videos, ensuring each gesture has its own label.
- Preprocess with MediaPipe or OpenCV to extract keypoints.
- Organize sequences into training, validation, and test folders.

## Training

- The model utilizes **categorical cross-entropy loss** and the **Adam** optimizer.
- You can customize the number of epochs, batch size, and other hyperparameters in `config.py` or the notebook.

## Results
